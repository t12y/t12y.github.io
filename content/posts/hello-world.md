We're the engineering team at Thought Foundry, Inc. We're a small, distributed group primarily focused on media and entertainment.

A little about us:
*  We use a lot of open source software
*  We build software that runs primarily in the cloud
*  We love solving problems is the simplest possible way

Does this sound like you too? Probably, it describes a lot of engineering teams these days.
We'll be sharing posts that cover these topics with the hope that we might help (or at least entertain) some folks who are working on similar problems.
